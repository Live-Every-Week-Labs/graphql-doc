# Errors

All error responses include a top-level `errors` array with a `message` and optional metadata.

## Common Error Codes

- `UNAUTHENTICATED`: Missing or invalid auth token.
- `FORBIDDEN`: Authenticated but not permitted for this operation.
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource does not exist.
- `RATE_LIMITED`: Too many requests in a short window.

## Partial Data

Some queries can return both `data` and `errors` when only part of the request fails.
Handle both to avoid missing valid results.
