# API Overview

Welcome to the API documentation. This section covers shared concepts, authentication,
and error handling so you can ship faster.

## Authentication

All requests require a valid access token. Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Pagination

List queries use cursor-based pagination. Use `first`/`after` to page forward and
`last`/`before` to page backward.
